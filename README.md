# TOPIC: Email Sending 
   This application provides a service to send emails using Node.js and Nodemailer. Below is a guide on how to set up and use the service.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Nodemailer package installed (npm install nodemailer)
- A configured email service (e.g., Gmail)

## Assignment
- For this assignment you have to create a new branch - assignment/emailSending

```
 	{
  "from": "xxxyyyy123@gmail.com",
  "to": "ramshankar@gmail.com",
  "subject": "for testing purpose2",
  "text": "Hi ramshankar, This mail is coming from Aman Gupta's email service application."
}

```

This setup allows you to send emails through a simple API. By sending a POST request with the appropriate JSON data using Postman, you can send an email if all configurations are correct.
